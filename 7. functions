//* Scoping *//
/ In JavaScript, scope refers to the visibility of variables. Variables defined outside of a function block have Global scope. 
/ Variables that are declared WITHOUT the let or const keywords are automatically created in the global scope.
/ Variables declared within a function, as well as the function parameters, have local scope. They are only visible within that function.

let myGlobal =10;  /global
function fun1() {
  oopsGlobal = 5 /global

}
console.log(oopsGlobal) /5

/this would return error/
function myLocalScope() {
  let myVar = 'here';
  console.log('inside myLocalScope', myVar);
}
console.log(myVar) 

/When local & global variables have the same name the LOCAL variable takes precedence over the GLOBAL variable.
const outerWear = "Shirt";
function myOutfit() {
  outerWear = "t-Shirt";
  return outerWear;
}
myOutfit(); // the output should be "t-Shirt"

/When the function doesn't have a return statement, when you call it, the function processes the inner code, the function will change the global variable but the returned value of the function is undefined.
let sum = 0;
function addSum(num) {
  sum += num;
}
addSum(3);
console.log(sum); /3
