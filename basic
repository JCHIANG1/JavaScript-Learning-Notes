/* strings */ 
/ It is common for developers to use uppercase variable identifiers for immutable values
/ lowercase or camelCase for mutable values (objects and arrays)

/ quoting strings with single quotes
const goodStr = ' A asks B, "Hey, let\'s go?"'; 
const badStr = 'B responds, "Let's go!"';

/* var, let, const */ 
/In JavaScript, String values are immutable, they cannot be altered using the bracket notation once created.
//this would output error//
let myStr = "Bob";
myStr[0] = "J";
//this would pass//
let myStr1 = "Bob";
myStr1 = "Job";

//this would pass// 
// var keyword -> you can easily overwrite variable declarations //
var camper = "James";
var camper = "David";
console.log(camper);

//this would failed//  
// let keyword -> unlike var, when use let, a variable with the same name can only be declared once. //
let camper1 = "James";
let camper1 = "David";
